# OneAmongMany
OneAmongMany - A puzzle game whereby you the player will fix challenging puzzles ,solely, using the tools that are given to you in each levels. Each level rises in difficulty and each time you complete it the demon itches from his slumber. Will you wake him up and face the challenge or cower in fear as he rots your world?
- Ignore OneAmongMany.py's description of the game plan, that description was for a later planned project but I decided a puzzle game will fit better.
#Detailed plan for the game.
1 - intro, basic ui:

1 Title for the game and 1 button labelled "Play". The look for the button can be anything.

2 - Level plan:
Any theme for the level and proceeding levels. 
There will be 5 Basic levels 2 Medium levels and 1 Hard level. The adjectives used for each level is in reference to the difficulty of the puzzle.
5 basic puzzle levels- 
1 basic - Grab the key.
Ground level will contain a simple ground with 1 jail-like container for the trigger to the next level. To open the door to that jail-like container you will have to grab the key. This will be done by climbing to heights near the y = 0 axis using platforms. This will enable to the player to get used to movement. We can, if we want, to enable a tutorial during this level.
2 Basic - Colour colour.
Like, Grab the Key, but this time the player will have to press on the correct combination of colours which, when mixed, will produce the colour of the door to the jail-like container. 

3 - Ending, any theme.
